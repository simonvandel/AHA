\section{Problem Formulation}
In the previous chapters, the current state of home automation as well as the users thereof were analysed and discussed. During these discussions, some concerns and delimitations for the scope of this project were presented. Taking these into consideration, a concrete problem formulation was devised, presenting a solvable problem in a delimited domain of home automation. The problem formulation is as follows:

\emph{How is it possible to create a system, that uses several sensors to learn the residents’ usage patterns in their home, to intelligently control lights and appliances in order to minimise power consumption and automate reoccurring tasks, while minimising user interaction.}
