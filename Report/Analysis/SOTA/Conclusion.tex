\subsection{Conclusions}
In this section existing systems for home automation were described in an effort to describe already explored ways to affect the problem domain. It is shown that while most aspects of home automation are covered, no system includes techniques from the field of machine learning.

Based on the analysis done in this section, this project will focus on controlling simple applications in the home, making the system adaptable, in an effort to reduce the interaction required by the user.
