\section{Conclusion \& Requirements}\label{sec:requirements}
This section will conclude on the analysis and, from the knowledge gathered in \cref{sec:sota} and \cref{sec:interviewReports} about existing systems, define some requirements for this new system.

Some requirements for the system are listed below.

\begin{itemize}
\item be able to learn usage patterns of users, in such a way that their usage patterns are automated
\item be entirely wireless
\item be conservative in its actions. It should be able to recognise whether an action is a temporary adjustment or a permanent change in schedule, meaning that it is better not to act then to act wrongly
\item minimise user interaction while still giving the user enough information to interact with the system appropriately
\item be able to display reasoning of actions taken
\item be able to control lighting and electronic appliances
\item be flexible, meaning that the system should be installable and expandable in a wide variety of homes
\end{itemize}
