­\section{Hidden Markov Model}
An initial implementation of a Markov chain in our problem domain could make the states in the model snapshots of the sensors in the home. A snapshot is here ment as the values of all sensors at the same time, ­\emph{snapshot} will from here on adhere to this definition.

 In a markov chain.
Hidden states: The real pattern the user is currently doing.
Evidence states: Snapshots of the problem domain.

Hidden Markov chains are the simplest form of

\subsection{Learning}
For learning the Baum-Welch algorithm, a specific implementatian of the forwards-backwards algorithm, was choosen.

\subsection{Prediction}
