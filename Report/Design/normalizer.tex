\section{Normaliser}
\label{sec:normaliser}
The purpose of the normaliser is to reduce the size of data such that large data can be handled. The Normalisation process consists of two parts. The first part is responsible for clustering the data using the method known as the elbow method. The second part is responsible for optimisation of these clusters. The optimisation part is to reduce number the number of clusters and thereby increase the accuracy of the clusters by eliminating hard breaks. The second part implies a method known as Jenks natural breaks optimisation.
