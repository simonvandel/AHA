This report describes the development of the AHA system, whose purpose is to ease the burden of performing typical actions in the household, which would otherwise be performed manually by a resident of the home. The system consists of an embedded and a learning subsystem.  The embedded subsystem is implemented on an Arduino Uno. The learning subsystem uses the Baum-Welch algorithm to learn a hidden Markov model, and uses the Viterbi algorithm to predict sensible actions to perform, based on the state of the home.
