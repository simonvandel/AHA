Because the XBee modules use significantly more time to send, the more data it has to send, an encoder was made\ranote{should probably be said when defining the comm protocol}. Because it cannot be assumed that every sensor station is identical, and therefore the data sent will not be identical, the master needs to know the structure of each packet of sensor data it receives.
\\\\
The encoder is set up as a stream. It takes a number of bits and has an internal buffer where the bits are pushed onto. The buffer is 64 bytes, because the XBee module used in the sensor stations can only send 64 byte packages. When the stream is to be used, it copies the buffer onto an input byte array, it is up to the caller to ensure that the input array is at least large enough to contain the data. For the implementation it is always given a 64 byte array, and then, when sending the data, it is defined how much of the array is filled.
