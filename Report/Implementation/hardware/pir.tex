\subsection{PIR Motion Sensor}\label{sub:pir}

The sensor used to detect movement is a passive infrared sensor (PIR). The model
number is \enquote{SEN32357P} and is manufactured by SEEED Studio. A data sheet
can be found in
\cite{datasheet_pir1}. The
sensor is implemented using the \enquote{BISS0001} integrated circuit. A data sheet for this can
be found in \cite{datasheet_pir2}.

According to the technical specifications, the sensor can measure movements from 0.1 m to 6 m away. The distance can be configured by rotating a potentiometer on the sensor. Clockwise means decreasing the distance. This is essentially the sensitivity of the sensor. A smaller distance means lower sensitivity. The detecting angle is 120 degree.

The sensor also has a potentiometer for configuring the time delay. The time
delay is the time the sensor reports movement after it is detected. So
if a movement is detected, the sensor with time delay set to 10 seconds will report that motion is detected for 10 seconds after the movement.
The time delay on this specific sensor can be adjusted from 1 second to 25 seconds. A switch, on the sensor, controls whether the sensor is retriggerable (H position) or unretriggerable (L position). In a retriggerable position, the delay time is extended every time movement is detected. In the unretriggerable mode, the delay time remaining is not reset when motion is detected.

The sensor has four pins, GND, VCC, NC and SIG. The sensor signals motion detected on its SIG pin. LOW on this pin means no motion and HIGH means motion.

An example of a setup can be seen in \cref{fig:arduino_pir_wiring}.

\subsubsection{Sampling Input Data}
To reduce noise on the signal of the sensor, the sensor is probed 10 times. The average of these readings is the result.
