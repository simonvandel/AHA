\section{User Scenarios}\label{sub:userscenarios}

Below are possible narratives of branches derived from the use cases, as described in \cref{sub:usecases}. It is not possible to describe every possible uses of the system, as there are infinitely many, even though the user scenarios below can be used as unit tests for the system; given some behaviour does the system act as describe in the scenarios?

\textit{A user enters the room. The system detects motion in the room, and can infer based on previous data that it should turn on the light. When the user leaves the room, the system turns off the light.}

\textit{A user is reading a book, the light intensity of the sun is low now due the time of the day, and the user is having trouble reading. The system has learned that at this light intensity when the user is situated at the couch with TV not running, the user now wants the light to be on.}

\textit{A user is home alone in his/her living room. The user leaves the room to go to the toilet but does not turn off the light in the living room, while on the toilet the user closes the door and does not observe the light in the living room being turned off by the system to conserve/save energy.}

%Just for fun ? Many users is situated in the living room and the volume(db) of the stereo is really high, so users is shouting to hear each other and this occurs over prolonged duration, the system intelligently lowers the volume without the user noticing. And at 1am/pm(night) the user normally goes to sleep but not today, but because of neighbours the system lowers the volume further.
