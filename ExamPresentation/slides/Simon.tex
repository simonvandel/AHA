\section{Tests and Verification}
\subsection{Methodology}
\begin{frame}{Methodology}
  Test setup: 3 digital sensors, 1 of them emulatable
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Deadline test
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Learn system XOR
        \item Activate timer button
        \item Observe timer results
      \end{itemize}
    \item Adaption test
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Learn system XOR
        \item Affect the system to learn AND instead
      \end{itemize}

      \end{itemize}
    \item Adaption test
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Learned the XOR pattern
        \item AND pattern is partly adapted to
        \item AND pattern not consistently performed
        \item Partly successful test
      \end{itemize}

\section{Demo}
\begin{frame}{Demo}
	\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain setup
		\item Starts with learning XOR
		\item 1:08 some of XOR is learned
		\item 3:43 switches to adapt to AND
		\item 5:40 it has learned some of AND
	\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion \& Reflection}
\begin{frame}{Conclusion \& Reflection 1/2}
	\begin{itemize}
    \item Sensors chosen based on problem domain
    \item Sensor characteristics understood by tests
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Confirmed: cheap hardware is often bad hardware
      \end{itemize}
    \item Sensors can be read on Arduino board, and transmitted wirelessly
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Wireless communication: more complexity -> increased development time
        \item Wired communication also possible, but less interesting
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion \& Reflection 2/2}
	\begin{itemize}
    \item System is able to learn a pattern, but not much can be said about its performance
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Only tested in trivial setting
        \item Max test time: 20 minutes -> small state space
        \item Hard to debug machine intelligence algorithms
      \end{itemize}
		\item Deadline for system is not met
      \begin{itemize}
      \item It is not critical, as it is a soft deadline. It can however be annoying for users
      \item Deadline maybe too strict, would have to be tested
      \end{itemize}
