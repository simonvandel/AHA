\section{Tests and Verification}
\subsection{Methodology}
\begin{frame}{Methodology}
  Test setup: 3 digital sensors, 1 of them emulatable
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Deadline test
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Learn system XOR
        \item Use timer button that activates a timer and performs an action
        \item Observe timer results in optimal and worst cases
      \end{itemize}
    \item Adaption test
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Learn system XOR
        \item Affect the system to learn AND instead
      \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Results}
\begin{frame}{Results}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Deadline test
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Deadline was 100 ms from change in state to the system performing an action
        \item The best observed time in the worst case test was 268 ms
        \item The best observed time in the optimal case test was 122 ms
        \item The deadline is therefore not met
      \end{itemize}
    \item Adaption test
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The system was able to learn the XOR pattern
        \item After around 2 minutes of trying to adapt to AND pattern, most of the XOR pattern is unlearned
        \item However, the system was not able to consistenly perform the newly learned AND pattern
        \item The test was partly successful, as the system was able to adapt to a new pattern, but the new pattern was not performed consistenly thereafter
      \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Demo}
\begin{frame}{Demo}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Starts with learning XOR
		\item At around 3:40 switches to adapt to AND
		\item At around 6:30 seems to have adapted to AND
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Conclusion \& Reflection}
\begin{frame}{Conclusion \& Reflection 1/2}
	\begin{itemize}
    \item Different sensors have been examined, and their characteristics understood
    \item The sensors can be read on the Arduino board, and can be sent wirelessly to a central server
      \begin{itemize}
        \item While the wireless communication added more complexity to the system and therefore increased the development time, it made the system more portable
      \end{itemize}
    \item A binary encoding scheme was designed
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Enabled small data packets, which reduced communication time
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion \& Reflection 2/2}
	\begin{itemize}
    \item System is able to learn a pattern, but not much can be said about its performance
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The system remains to be tested in a non-trivial setting, where additional (noisy) sensors and more complex patterns exist
        \item No tests have been running for more than 20 minutes at a time. In a real world environment, the system would collect much more data over a large amount of time
        \item Hard to debug the machine intelligence algorithms, as it is hard to reason about the correctness of the output 
      \end{itemize}
		\item Deadline for system is not met
      \begin{itemize}
      \item It is not critical, as it is a soft deadline. It can however be annoying for users
      \item The deadline might be too strict. Maybe it is fine to loosen the deadline in a real environment. This would have to be tested in a usability lab
      \end{itemize}
